1. Looking back I used up unneccesary space by creating a duplicate of the vocab array (vocabDupl) just to add back to vocab if the word had not already appeared. This could have been accomplished using only the original vocab array.

2. For a long time I was unable to check if my getCounts was working properly because I was having an issue with mapping my scanner to my text file. So I coded that entire method basically blind. I eventually made more and more use of print statements in my constructor to check values of many things including the length of my vocab ArrayList as well as its contents. I also created a LanguageModelTest.java which had arguments already filled in so I would not have to use the command line every time I wanted to check if it was working properly. Midway through I also switched from callofwild.txt to grimms.txt so I could see my files looked the same as the example files.

3. The most challenging part of this assignment for me was getting started. I have never written a program where I am not initializing variables to specific values so that was new to me. In the beginning it was hard for me to wrap my head around but felt more natural towards the end. I also ran into many problems with my scanner because it did not want to map to my text file. This is where I started bringing in print statements to identify exactly where the problem was. After help from 4 or more tutors, we were able to identify that my program was wanting to run one folder upstream from where all of my files were because of the way that I cloned my repository.
